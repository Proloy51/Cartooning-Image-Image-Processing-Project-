This is my image processing and computer vision lab project. The project allows the users to read any image from the local disk and to select which type of image he/she wants to get. There are 3 different types of cartooning effects.

Types of Cartoon Effects:
   1. Color Quantization
   2. Comic Book Style
   3. Edge Detection method

Technology Used:
   1. Python
   2. OpenCV: For image processing and transformations.
   3. NumPy: For efficient mathematical operations.
